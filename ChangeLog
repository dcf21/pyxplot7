	  / transparent / solid / invert / noinvert implemented.
	- set dpi implemented, to allow user to choose quality of gif/jpg/png
	  output.
	- `set grid' command now allows user to specify which axes grid attaches
	  to. (extended API)
	- Support introduced for plotting gzipped datafiles. Filenames ending in
	  '.gz' are assumed to be gzipped.
	- load command implemented.
	- move command implemented.

2006 Apr 27: GnuPlot+ 0.4.0
	- Bug fix: now looks for input scripts in the user's cwd, not in /tmp.
	- 'set logscale' is now valid syntax (as in gnuplot), as well as 'set log'.
	- multiplot implemented, including linked axes, though with some brokenness
	if linked axes are allowed to autoscale.
	- 'dots' plotting style implemented.
	- Bug fix: can now include a plot 'with' clause after an 'axes' clause;
	could not previously without an error message arising.
	- Pointstyles now increment between plotted datasets, even in a colour
	terminal where the colours also increment.
	- garbage collection of .eps files from the X11 terminal added. Previously
	they were left to fester in /tmp.

	- unset command implemented.
	- set notitle implemented.

2006 Apr 14: GnuPlot+ 0.3.2
	- The autoscaling of logarithmic axes made more trust-worthy: error checks
	to ensure that they do not try to cover negative ordinates.
	- Error checks put in place to prevent empty keys being plotted, which made
	PyX crash previously. Now can plot empty graphs happily.
	- Datasets with blank titles removed from the key, to allow users to plot
	some datasets to be omitted from the key. This is not possible in gnuplot.
	- Bug fix to prevent PyX's texrunner from crashing irreparably upon
	receiving bad LaTeX. Now uses a spanner to attempt to return it to working
	order for the next plot.
	- Bug fix to the autoscaling of axes with no range of data -- previous did
	not work for negative ordinates. Now displays an axes with a range of +/-
	1.0 around the data.

2006 Apr 12: GnuPlot+ 0.3.1
	- Plotting of functions fixed: plot command will now plot any algebraic
	expression, not just functions of the form f(x).
	- Space added after command prompt.

2006 Apr 12: GnuPlot+ 0.3.0
	- X11_singlewindow and X11_multiwindow terminals implemented, as distinct
	from just standard X11.

	well as in the corners of the plot. Key allowed to be offseted in position.
	- Datasets colours can be set via 'plot with colour <n>'
	- Datasets are split when there is a blank line in the datafile; lines are
	not joined up between the two segments.
	- set size implemented; can now change aspect ratio of plots.
	- working directory of GnuPlot+ changed to /tmp, so that LaTeX's temporary
	files are stored there rather than in the user's cwd.

2006 Mar 30: GnuPlot+ 0.2.0
	- Standard GnuPlot dual axes improved upon, allowing users to add x3, x4
	axes, etc, up to any number of axes that may be desired.
	- Autocomplete mechanism for commandline substantially cleaned up and
	debugged.
	- Bug fixes to the plotting of arrows/labels. Now appear *above* gridlines,
	not below.
